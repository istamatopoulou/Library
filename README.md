# The LIBRARY Case Study

## Instructions
- Download everything from this repo
- Create a **new** Library project in your eclipse (or other IDE)
- Import everything from this repo to your new project

## What this repo contains
Everything we have done in class throughout the semester. Additionally:
- **Two versions** of the `Library` class:

  - The first is called `LibraryLists` and is essentially the class we have been working on together (using `ArrayList` as an implementation of the `List` interface)

  - The second is called `LibraryMaps` and uses maps as a collection for members, titles, and borrowables (more particularly, it uses `HashMap` as implementation of the `Map` interface)

   - Note that in both its versions, the Library class contains more methods than we had time to do in class, which you may find interesting!

- A "dummy" program, which is not so dummy! Study and run the `LibraryProgram`. In the uploaded version, it creates an object of the `LibraryLists` class (line 15). However, you may chage this to create an object of the `LibraryMaps` class.

- To run the version with the Graphical User Interface we created in class, run `GUImain`.
